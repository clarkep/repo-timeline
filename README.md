## Repository Timeline Generator
```get-tl``` is a short python script for generating a project timeline from a git repository. The output can be used to quickly scan the development of a project. It comes with sane defaults and a few configuration options.

To use, give it the name of a git repository:
```
$ get-tl ffmpeg
```
or run it without argument _in_ a git repository. 

This project is a work in progress.
